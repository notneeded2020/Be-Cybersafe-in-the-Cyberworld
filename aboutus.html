         <h2>Pramiti Mohapatra</h2>
         <p>I'm Pramiti Mohapatra. A Whitehat Jr student, a bright and outgoing person, someone who is 
            fascinated by computers, loves music more than anything, and has self-love and self-care as her first priority. I love 
            to look on the brighter side of things and think that one shouldn't feel hurt by negative 
            feedback and that one should take it as something to work on and improve rather than going to
            a corner and crying for eternity. Once I thrive something, I'll be at peace only after it's done.  </p> 
        
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p> My mission is to spread the awareness of cybersafety among everyone; from kids to elders; 
            around the globe.I still have a long way to go as a Whitehat Jr student. Still have a lot to learn,
            a lot to discover, a lot to do. I wish that once I would have completed all my classes with 
            Whitehat Jr, and would be a proud coder, I will build an app and help many people from falling 
            victim to cyberbullying and the dangers of the internet. </p>
