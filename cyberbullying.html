            <h1>What is cyberbullying?</h1>

            <p>When a young person uses the Internet or technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or 
                target another person, this person is called a cyberbully. Typically, cyberbullying 
                involves tweens and teens; but it's not uncommon for adults to experience cyberbullying 
                and public shaming as well.</p>

             <p>Compared to traditional bullying, the effects of cyberbullying are often more significant.
                Not only do the hurtful messages reach an unlimited audience, but the words and images 
                are often preserved online.</p>
                
             <p>Even if someone deletes a mean post, chances are it's still available in some form such as
                a screenshot or a shared text message. Worse yet, those targeted by cyberbullies often don't
                know who is bullying them, so they often have no way to bring it to an end.</p>

              <h1> Types of cyberbullying </h1> 

             <p>Teens are online now more than ever. Every day they use their smartphones, tablets, and 
              computers not only to research material for school but to socialize with friends and family
              members.</p>

              <p>In fact, texting and using social media is one of the top ways kids communicate with others. 
              But just like any other social activity, the opportunity for bullying exists.</p>


              <p>While there are a number of different ways kids are bullying others online, 
              the majority of online harassment falls into one of six categories. Here are six of the most 
              common methods of cyberbullying.</p>
              
              <ul type="bullet">

             <li><b>Harassment: </b>Harassing someone is a common method of online bullying. This type of cyberbullying occurs
                when someone uses strategies to torment another person.</li>
             <li><b>Impersonation: </b>A cyberbully also may impersonate another person, causing problems in that person's life.</li>
             <li><b>Website Creation: </b>A bully may create a website, blog, or poll to harass another person.</li>
             <li><b>Video Shaming: </b>The use of videos may be used for online bullying. These short clips
                 are often extremely hurtful to the people being targeted.</li>

              </ul>
