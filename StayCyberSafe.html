       Almost everyone uses the internet these days. You're able to view this website because you have access
       to the internet. This website is on the web open for anyone to view. Students use the internet for 
       their school projects. Teachers use the internet for more information on a topic, so that the students 
       can be taught more. Buisness men and women use the internet to market their products. Artists put their art 
       on show on the internet too for people to view and their talent to be appreciated. Musicians put their music 
       on the internet and people listen to it with joy. There are so many uses of the internet. We can't imagine 
       our lives without it.

        <p>
        Let me ask you a question- Is the internet really a safe place?
        There are so many people connected to the internet, as mentioned above. 
        We don't know the people on the internet, we don't know if they are trust-worthy, 
        we don't know if they're safe to talk with. 
        </p>
   
        <p>
          You must have had your parents,teachers or elders say "Don't talk with strangers" when you were younger.
          They said so because we don't know what those strangers may do to you. Same way, we can't trust everyone
          on the internet.
        </p>
   
        <p>
           Along with students,teachers,buisness men and other people accessing the internet, there are 
            hackers,kidnappers,bullies and other shady people accessing the internet as well. In order to prevent any 
            danger towards us or our information, we must <b>stay cybersafe.</b>
        </p>

        <p> Some dangers of the internet :- 
            <ul type='bullet'>
                <li><b>Cyberbullying</b> is probably the best known out of these. This mostly happens to 
                kids and teens on social media platforms. 90% of teens agree that cyber bullying a problem, 
                and 63% believe this is a serious problem. What’s more, a 2018 survey of children’s online 
                behavior found that approximately 60% of children who use social media have witnessed some 
                form of bullying, and that, for various reasons, most children ignored the behavior.It's a problem 
                all over the world. Take a look at the chart below.</li>

                    <img src="cyberBully.png" width="350px" height="350px" class="image"/>
                    <div class="overlay">
                        <div class="text"><a href="cyberbullying.html">Cyberbullying rate over the world</a></div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <li><b>Cyber Predators</b> often stalk children on the internet, taking advantage of their
                     innocence, lack of adult supervision and abusing their trust.This can culminate 
                     in children being lured into dangerous personal encounters in real life. These 
                     predators lurk on social media and gaming platforms that appeal to children — the 
                     same virtual venues where anonymity facilitates cyber bullying. </li>

                     <div class="container">
                        <img src="cyberpredator.jpg" width="350px" height="350px" class="image"/>
                        <div class="overlay">
                            <div class="text"><a href="cyberpredator.html"> Cyber predator luring a kid to meet</a></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                <li><b>Phishing</b> is what cyber security professionals call the use of emails that try to
                     trick people into clicking on malicious links or attachments. These can be 
                     especially difficult for kids to detect because often, the email will appear to be
                      from someone legitimate, like a friend or family member, saying simply,
                       "Hey—thought you might like this!" This can also be done with using messaging apps
                       or text messages—then it's called "smishing".</li>

                       <div class="container">
                        <img src="phishing.jpg" width="350px" height="350px" class="image"/>
                        <div class="overlay">

                    </div>

            </ul>
        </p>
   
        <p>
            Some examples for the above mentioned dangers:-
            <ul type="bullet">
                <li>You upload a dance cover on youtube. Someone uses your photo to morph and post the same 
                    without your concent to which you get negative views, causing social harrasment therby leading to  
                    self conciousness and depression, making you stressed and affecting your mental health.
                 </li>

                 <div class="container">
                    <img src="cyberbullying1.jpg" width="350px" height="350px" class="image"/>
                    <div class="overlay">
                        <div class="text"> An illustration of cyberbullying</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <li>Someone DMs you. That person seems nice and sweet, but their Instagram account is privated and 
                    you can't view it. But you blindly trust them, and give vital informations about yourself. A few days
                    later your Instagram account gets hacked and you can't access it anymore.
                </li>

                <div class="container">
                    <img src="hacking.png" width="350px" height="350px" class="image"/>
                    <div class="overlay">
                        <div class="text"> An illustration of Hacking</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </ul>
            The above examples are only the tip of the iceberg of the danger on the internet. Worse things can happen if you're not safe.

            How do we stay cybersafe? Some of you may know many ways to stay cybersafe, but there
            are many people out there who know little to nothing about cybersafety.</p>
            
        <p> My app, "Stay Cybersafe",will teach people ways to stay cybersafe through 
            real-life stimulations,small tips that teach various ways to stay cybersafe, 
            prevent cyber bulllying and how to not fall for phishing and other scams, and 
            through illustrations. It's my dream to build this app after I would have
            learnt about app development, so that I can help many people from falling
            victim to cyberbullying, phishing and other scams. </p>
