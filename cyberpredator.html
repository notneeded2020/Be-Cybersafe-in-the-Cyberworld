        <h1> Who are Cyber Predators?</h1>
        <p>A Cyber Predator is an adult who uses the internet to exploit children and/or teens with the
            intention of inflicting sexual, emotional, psychological, or financial abuse.</p>

        <h1>How do they lure kids into their traps?</h1>
        <p>Cyber Predators connect with children and teens through chat rooms, instant messaging, social 
           networks, video games, and more.  They often pretend to be a child or teen and use their online
           connections to manipulate and groom victims to gain their trust over time. Cyber Predators work
           to build a relationship with online victims, then use that relationship to take advantage of 
           unsuspecting children and teens. </p>
        <h1> Is anything being done against cyber predators?</h1>
        <p>Yes.Cyber Predators can be sent to prison if caught and convicted of crimes against children.
            However, predators cannot be caught if they aren't reported.</p>
