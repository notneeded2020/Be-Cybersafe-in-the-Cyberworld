        <h1><u>Phishing</u></h1>
        <p>Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or
           text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing
           sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details,
           and passwords.</p>

        <p>The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft
        and financial loss.</p>

            <li><b>Lucrative offers to get you to click: </b> Lucrative offers and eye-catching or attention-grabbing
                 statements are designed to attract peopleâ€™s attention immediately.A cyber criminal
                may send you an email saying, "Congrats! you won an iPhone" and attach some link to it,

                fast because the super deals are only for a limited time. Some of them will even tell you
                that you have only a few minutes to respond. </li>
